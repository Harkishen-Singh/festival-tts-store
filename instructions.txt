Building Festival TTS on Fedora Quick note
FEBRUARY 25TH, 2018
The Festival packages on Fedora are Broken
Some work has taken place in the upstream tar-balls to upgrade to make the code work with the newer gcc, but this doesn’t seem to have made it into the RPMs yet.

Building Festival locally
As root you just need :

dnf install ncurses-devel
And then as a user on the command line:

mkdir festival-local
cd festival-local  # This is where we'll build festival locally
Download the source(s) and a suitable voice

# http://festvox.org/packed/festival/2.5/
wget http://festvox.org/packed/festival/2.5/speech_tools-2.5.0-release.tar.gz
wget http://festvox.org/packed/festival/2.5/festival-2.5.0-release.tar.gz
wget http://festvox.org/packed/festival/2.5/festlex_CMU.tar.gz
wget http://www.festvox.org/packed/festival/2.4/festlex_POSLEX.tar.gz
#wget http://festvox.org/packed/festival/2.5/voices/festvox_cmu_us_clb_cg.tar.gz  # Not found by default_voices.sh
wget http://festvox.org/packed/festival/2.5/voices/festvox_cmu_us_slt_cg.tar.gz
Actually, ‘nina’ would be a better voice, but download is difficult to find…

Unpack everything
tar -xzf  speech_tools*.tar.gz
tar -xzf  festival*.tar.gz
tar -xzf  festlex_CMU.tar.gz
tar -xzf  festlex_POSLEX.tar.gz
tar -xzf  festvox_cmu_us_slt_cg.tar.gz
Build speech_tools
cd speech_tools
./configure
gmake
cd ..
Build festival itself
cd festival
./configure
gmake
cd ..
Test festival on command line
cd festival/bin

# Try the simplest invocation (to audio output)
echo "This is a test" | ./festival --tts  # Needs /dev/dsp => FAIL

# Send instead to a local WAV file : WORKS!!
echo "This is a test" | ./text2wave -o test.wav
# Output is a mono WAV at 16KHz
Install festival system-wide (?)
It wasn’t necessary to install festival nor speech_tools system-wide in order to get the TTS functionality required.

All done.
